## Overview

This application utilizes artificial intelligence technology to analyze the ingredients in nail polishes. It checks for the presence of toxic substances in these ingredients and provides detailed information on why these substances are harmful to health. If no toxic components are detected, the user receives a congratulatory message. Our goal is to empower consumers to make informed decisions about the products they use.

## Features

- **Ingredient Analysis:** The app performs ingredient analysis of nail polishes using a photo.
- **Detection of Toxic Components:** It identifies and lists any toxic components present in the nail polishes.
- **Detailed Information:** Provides detailed information on why toxic components are harmful to health.
- **User-Friendly Feedback:** Offers user-friendly feedback, congratulating the user when no toxic components are found.

## Installation

To install and set up the application, follow these steps:

1. Download the application from the [Apple or Google Store].
2. Install the app on your [iOS/Android] device.
3. Upon launching the app, follow the instructions to signUp and login.

## Usage

1. Open the app on your device.
2. Tap the button to capture a photo of the nail polish ingredients.
3. The app will process the image and show the analysis results.
4. If toxic components are found, the app will explain why they are harmful to health.
5. If no toxic components are detected, the app will congratulate the user on making a safe choice.

## Technical Details

- **Current Status (MVP):** We are currently in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage, where we have developed core functionality to validate the concept.
- **Architecture (MVC):** The app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to organize and separate concerns within the codebase.
- **State Management (Bloc):** We utilize the Bloc pattern for efficient state management, allowing for seamless updates and a responsive user interface.

While our current project is in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage, my vision extends beyond its initial implementation. I am committed to continuously enhancing this application. Post-validation, my plan includes a comprehensive refactoring effort aimed at improving the project's architecture and enhancing the separation of services. I will also prioritize the implementation of thorough testing procedures to ensure the highest level of reliability and maintainability. My goal is to evolve this project into a robust and feature-rich application that continues to empower users with valuable insights about nail polish ingredients. Your feedback and contributions will play a crucial role in shaping its future.
